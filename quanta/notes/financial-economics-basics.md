# Basics of Financial Economics


## Terminology

### Assets
- **Stocks**: ownership shares in a company; when you buy a stock, you own a portion of that company and may receive dividends and/or capital gains
- **Equity**: another word for ownership in an asset, typically a company; in finance, equity refers to stock shares or the net value of an asset after subtracting liabilities
- **Bonds**: debt instruments issued by governments or corporations to raise capital; when you buy a bond, you’re lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and repayment of the principal at maturity
- **Securities**: broad term for tradable financial assets, including stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, and other investment products
- **Derivatives**: financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, index, commodity, or interest rate; common derivatives include options, futures, and swaps
- **Options**:  type of derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a specific price before or on a specific date; includes longs and shorts
- **Futures**: financial contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase, and the seller to deliver, an asset at a predetermined price and date in the future
- **Index Funds**: passive mutual funds or ETFs designed to track the performance of a specific market index; they offer broad market exposure and low fees
- **Mutual Funds**: pooled investment vehicles managed by professionals, where investors buy shares and the fund invests in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities
- **ETFs**: like mutual funds, but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks; ETFs typically track indices and are known for low costs and intraday liquidity
- **Dividends**: a cash payment (or sometimes additional stock) made by a company to its shareholders, usually from profits
- **Commodities**: basic physical goods that are interchangeable with other goods of the same type; often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services (hard: natural resources that are mined/extracted vs soft: agricultural products or livestack that are grown/raised)
- **Liquidity**: ease with which an asset or security can be converted into cash without affecting its market value

### Actions
- **Splits**: increases the number of shares a company has without changing the total value of your investment
- **Longs**: taking a long position means you buy an asset expecting its price will rise in the future, allowing you to sell it at a profit
- **Shorts**: selling an asset you don’t own (typically borrowed), hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and profit from the price decline


### Metrics
- **Basis Point**: 1 basis point corresponds to 1/100th of a percentage 
point i.e. 0.01%
- **Capacity**: how much a strategy is able to absorb without negatively impacting returns
- **Yield**: income (usually interest) you earn from an investment expressed as a percentage of its cost or value
- **Revenue**: total amount of money a company earns i.e. $\text{Price} \times \text{Quantity}$
- **Profit**: net income after subtracting expenses i.e. $\text{Revenue} - \text{Total Expenses}$



## Concepts

### P/E Ratio

Price-to-Earnings ratio: how much investors are willing to pay for $1 for a company's earnings

$\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}$
- Price per Share: current market price of the stock
- EPS: Earnings per share over the last 12 months (usually)
\
- high P/E ~ high market expectations, low P/E ~ cheap stock/company decline
- useful for comparing companies int he same sector, screening value & growth stocks, over/under-valuation
- can be misleading if earnings are volatile or manipulated
