# Day Trading Price Action

## Break of Structure (BOS) vs Change of Character (ChoCH)

- Structure = sequence of swing highs/lows; BOS confirms trend continuation, ChoCH signals potential reversal.
- **BOS:** candle closes through prior swing high in an uptrend (or swing low in a downtrend) after displacement; favors continuation trades in direction of the break.
- **ChoCH:** first meaningful break of the opposite-side swing after a trend leg; hints at distribution/accumulation shift and opens the door for reversal setups.
- Track the higher‑time‑frame bias first, then use BOS/ChoCH on execution time frames to refine entries and invalidate quickly if structure shifts back.

## Swing Highs & Swing Lows

- Swing high: a local peak where the high is preceded and followed by lower highs; often marks resistance/liquidity above.
- Swing low: a local trough where the low is preceded and followed by higher lows; often marks support/liquidity below.
- Use swings to define market structure (HH/HL in uptrends, LH/LL in downtrends) and to anchor BOS/ChoCH decisions, stops, and targets.

## Support & Resistance Zones

- Support: area where demand historically absorbs supply and price bounces; often prior swing lows, OB bases, or FVG mids. Acts as a floor until broken.
- Resistance: area where supply historically caps advances; often prior swing highs, OB tops, or unfilled FVG tops. Acts as a ceiling until broken.
- Expect liquidity just beyond these zones; sweeps through them can seed reversals or fuel breakouts depending on acceptance/rejection beyond the level.
- Map zones on higher time frames, then refine to execution time frame; avoid trading inside chop between closely stacked zones.

## Liquidity Sweeps & Runs

- Stops and resting orders cluster above equal highs/inside prior highs, and below equal lows/inside prior lows; sweeps wick through these pools to fill large orders.
- Tells: quick wick through a level followed by rejection, strong displacement back inside range, or volume spike without continuation.
- Trade idea: wait for the sweep, then enter in the direction of rejection with the sweep wick as invalidation; target the opposite side of the range or next liquidity pool.
- Avoid fading healthy breakouts—require failure to hold beyond the swept level before committing.

## Order Blocks (OBs)

- Defined as the last up candle before a sharp down move that breaks structure (bearish OB) or the last down candle before a sharp up move that breaks structure (bullish OB).
- Represent areas where institutions likely accumulated positions; mitigation rally back into the OB often offers low-risk entries aligned with the structural move.
- Confluence: OB located at/near liquidity pools, alignment with higher‑time‑frame bias, and displacement leaving the block.
- Invalidated when price accepts beyond the block (e.g., closes past the opposite end), suggesting absorption rather than mitigation.

## Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) & Imbalances

- A three‑candle pattern with no overlap between candle 1’s wick and candle 3’s wick, leaving a price void the market skipped over (imbalance).
- Price often rebalances by trading back into the gap; the 50% level of the FVG is commonly watched for reactions or partial fills.
- Use FVGs left by impulsive moves as continuation levels; ideal when paired with BOS/ChoCH and an adjacent order block for structure + imbalance confluence.
- A clean FVG that remains unfilled across sessions can act as a magnet/target; multiple stacked FVGs strengthen the draw on price.

## Inverse Fair Value Gaps (IFVGs)

- Opposite of a classic FVG: candle 1 and candle 3 wicks overlap but candle bodies do not, implying aggressive two‑sided trading with unfinished business in the bodies.
- Often acts as a rejection band—price may tap into the overlap and flip away, especially when it aligns with an order block or liquidity sweep.
- Treat IFVGs as areas to fade into the prior impulse; invalidate if price accepts through the full candle bodies.

## Balanced Price Action

- Occurs when overlapping wicks/bodies show both sides traded thoroughly (e.g., equal highs/lows, micro consolidations after displacement).
- Suggests liquidity has been collected and orders matched; price tends to move away toward the next imbalance once balance is achieved.
- Balanced zones make poor entry locations but good take‑profit areas; look for the next unbalanced level (FVG/OB) to re‑engage.

## Consolidation

- Sideways price action with overlapping candles/wicks and no meaningful BOS in either direction; a market in balance accumulating orders.
- Commonly forms between stacked support/resistance or after a displacement leg; often precedes expansion as liquidity builds at range extremes.
- Trade the break with confirmation (displacement + acceptance) or fade sweeps of the range edges back toward the midpoint until a true break occurs.

## Stop Losses & Take Profits

- **Stop loss:** predefined exit for risk control; place beyond invalidation (e.g., beyond sweep wick, outside order block, past structure level) rather than arbitrary ticks.
- **Take profit:** predefined exit to lock gains; place at opposing liquidity (prior swing, untapped FVG/OB, range edge) or use partials to realize R-multiples while leaving runners.
- Favor asymmetric R/R: size so 1R risk sits beyond invalidation while 2–3R targets align with logical liquidity draws; trail stops only after structure confirms in your direction.
- Preplan both stops and targets before entry to avoid emotional decisions and to standardize expectancy across trades.

## Practical Playbook

- Establish bias using higher‑time‑frame structure (HH/HL or LH/LL) and key liquidity pools.
- Wait for displacement + imbalance creation, then hunt for mitigation into OB/FVG in the direction of bias.
- Enter after a sweep/ChoCH on the execution time frame to refine risk; invalidate at the sweep wick or beyond the block.
- Target opposing liquidity (recent highs/lows, untapped FVG midpoints) and scale out as price rebalances.
